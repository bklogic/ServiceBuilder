# Data Access Application

The way to access relational database in cloud.

## Development  

Now that you have created the application, you may want to further

- configure the data source for the application
- create data access module(s)
- create and test data access service(s), and
- finally push the application into a GIT repository for runtime deployment

You may find how to do the first three steps in the Getting Started tutorial. For the last step, we assume that you are familiar with GIT and the `Source Control` extension of VSCode and know how to commit the changes and to push the application into your remote GIT repository.

## DEV Deployment

The application is automatically deployed to your workspace as the application and modules are created and the services are tested succeessful. However, you can always deploy an application, module or service manually to the workspace using the context menu, as needed.

## Runtime Deployment

You will need

- Register your AWS account as a runtime enviroment
- Create a runtime instance in your VPC, and then
- Deploy your application to the runtime instance from your GIT repository

all from the Service Console.
